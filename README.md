# Hi there, I'm Harshit Pandey! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a passionate and continuous learner with a keen interest in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**.

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, I believe that understanding and leveraging data effectively is the key to growth in any field. My journey into Data Science has been driven by a deep curiosity to create **impactful machine learning and AI models** that solve problems and drive meaningful decisions.

Before stepping into AI and Data Science, I successfully managed my own **e-commerce business**, where I developed strong business acumen, problem-solving abilities, and a deep understanding of financial and operational aspects. These experiences have shaped my ability to **combine business insights with data** to create powerful solutions.

I started my professional journey as a **Chartered Accountant (CA) student**, gaining comprehensive experience in various **bank audits**, from concurrent audits to statutory audits. This experience helped me build **solid financial skills and a strong analytical mindset**, which now play a crucial role in my data-driven approach.

I am always excited about applying my knowledge to real-world scenarios and bringing my **diverse skill set to the tech world**, where I aim to make a meaningful impact by using data in innovative ways.
